Welcome to the Django CRUD Application! ðŸš€ This project showcases my development skills in Python and Django by implementing a simple yet effective CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. The application allows users to manage student information with ease. It includes features for adding new students, viewing a list of students, updating student details, and deleting student records. By leveraging Django's powerful ORM, this application ensures efficient database operations and a smooth user experience. Whether you're a developer looking to understand Django better or someone interested in managing student data, this project serves as a practical example of how to build and structure a basic web application with Django. ðŸ“šðŸ”§âœ¨
